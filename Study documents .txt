** Train with Shubham **




Self study ::


Basic work of Devops enginner is to buid the code and deploy 



Git and Githud ::

- Code management
- Version control system 
- collabration 

Docker :: 


- Docker container --
   It basically build on container for code so that the code can run and work on any system and OS.
   We are creating a containers in Docker 
   
- Virtualization  
- Code will build in Docker

Jenkin ::

Jenkin will help in creating a CI/CD pipeline 

In CI/CD pipeline or with the help of CI/CD pipeline the we can automate the process of build , test and deploy .

 -- The code will be build in Docker and then al test cases will be passed and the ode will be deploy on server .....this is the flow of automation .
 
 -- We are writing the script in jenkin to automate the process 

Kubernetes ::

-- it is the tool used for container orchestration

-- Kubernetes will manage the all the containers  


Infra as Code ::

-- It contains the two part : - 

    1) - Provisiong = Terraform and cloudformation 
	
	2) - Configuration management = Ansible and Chef 
	
	We are writing the code to manage the configuration / System 
	
Grafana ::

 -- It is the tool used for monitoring purpose 




Linux Fundamentals :: 


** Adj**
- Open source 
- Allow multi user to used and multitask with powerfull shell 
- High seciurity 

* The linux archi *

Application >> Shell >> Kernel >> Hardware 

Application can interact with hardware using Kernel and we can give command to kernel through shell.

 
  
 --/home -Every user will contain in /home
 
 For user everything will be contain in cd /home/username
 
 
for eg . cd /home/ubuntu

- logs will be contain in cd /var/logs
**Commands **

= echo ___ - to print anything

** While coping a file the current location is donated by sinle dot (.)

** to create file like file1.txt , file2.txt , file3.txt .....upto file10.txt then use command = touch file{1..10}.txt


** To add user in linux **

= sudo useradd vaibhav_dev -m         ...(vaibhav_dev is username )

>> to set a password for user = passwd vaibhav_dev

 to set password==sudo passwd vaibhav_devops
 
 >> to know how many and wheather user is added or not = sudo cat /etc/passwd
 
 >> to add group = sudo groupadd devops
 >> to check wheather group is present or not = sudo cat /etc/group
 
 >> to add user in group = sudo gpasswd -a vaibhav_dev devops   { -a is for the adding the single user }
 >> to add multiple user in a group = sudo gpasswd -M vaibhav_test,vaibhav_devops devops    { -M is use to adding a multiple user } 
 
 what is sudo ?
 
 it is the group which has given all permission as root user.
 
 >> to change the permission for the file = sudo chmod 761 vaibhav_test   { 761 is the number ...for the permissions } 
 
 >> to change the file permissions = sudo chmod 777 vaibhav_test     
 
 >> to search anything use grep command = grep -r devops /home/ubuntu/  
 
 >> Study awk command 
 
 
 
 >> to get to know about services running in your machine = top
 
 >> to get top services in your machine = top -b 
 
  = systemctl >>> it is used to get know about status   ( systemctl will give the status of services which are running in background ) 
  
  = service >> it is used to get know about status 
  
  ** Shell scripting ** 
  
  Shell script always start with =#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh
  
  use echo to print anything 
  
  
  >> to run script use  = bash script_name or ./script_name
  
  
  
  >>  Everytime first make a script and then give permission to the user to read ,write and execute .and then run .
  
  
  >>  steps ::
  
               - make a directory and then folder 
			   - then make a file with .sh extension
			   - write script 
			   - we an execute the script without giving permission via bash command.
			   - or give permission to user with ./scipt_name
			   - 
			   
			   
   

 >> = echo $shell   >> to know the current shell status
 
 >> to print the variable name put $ before variable 
 
 = uptime 
 >> = who 
 
 >> if condition
 
 >> =df -h -- to know how much disk space is remaining
